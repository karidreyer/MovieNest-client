# Movie Nest App

## Introduction

The Move Nest App is an app developed as a student project, focused on allowing users to access information about different movies. It is a single-page, responsive app with routing, rich interactions, several interface views, and a polished user experience. The Movie Nest app is designed as a client-side piece to support the existing server-side Movie Nest API, which was built to facilitate user requests and render the response from the server-side via a number of different interface views.
